# AstFocus
This repository provides a simple implementation of the work [“Efficient Robustness Assessment via
Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Focus on Videos”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474085.3475395)

**Demo:**

Here, we provide 5 video clips in folder "dataset_numpy", you can run the following script and observe the effect:

```python
python Untarget_attack_test.py   # untargeted attack
```

or

```python
python Target_attack.py    # targeted attack
```
